Project: To-Do List - built with React

Status: currently can only add new tasks, not edit or delete yet

React concepts used:

- props
- listening to events & eventHandlers
- working with state, lifting the state up
- rendering lists of data

Things You Told Me To Keep In Mind:

- use .jsx if its a jsx file
- all file names should use PascalCase
- variables should use camelCase
- use self-closing html tags where possible
