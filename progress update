Attempted to filter rendered components off their 'checked' status by clicking the complete button.
Current thought processs
1. check the checkbox sets checkBoxStatus=true in TaskItem.jsx
2. this variable is lifted in TaskList.jsx and updates the relevant object
3. use filter method to filter for objects that contain checked:true, then rendered

Problem
- I dont know how to update the individual object key:value pair.
